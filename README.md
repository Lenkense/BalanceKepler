# Balance Kepler
Calculating areas using Kepler's 2nd Law
This was used to calculate Sway Area using Kepler's 2nd Law. Center of Mass position was determined using a force plataform and specifications provided by the manufacuter. Velocity was calculated using a Savitzky-Golay filter. Sway Area was calculated by integrating the modulus of the angular momentum.
